# PGSA - Perturbation-based Gene Set Analysis

The package implements the PGSA (Perturbation-based Gene Set Analysis)
    algorithm which accounts for pathway co-regulation
    and provides conservative statistical inference through iterative data perturbation,
    K-means clustering, and regression-based p-value calibration.
